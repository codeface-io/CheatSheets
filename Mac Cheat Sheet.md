# Mac Cheat Sheet

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Intent | Key Command |
| --------- | ----------- |
| Rename a selected file, folder or Numbers cell | ⌥⏎ |
| Delete a selected file, folder or email | ⌘⌫ |
| Show/hide hidden files | ⌘⇧. (Cmd Shift Dot) |

* show the defaults of an app: `defaults read -app <app-name>`
* clear the defaults of a macOS app: `defaults delete -app <app-name>`
