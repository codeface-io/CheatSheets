## Setup

You could "install" the shell scripts in this section by adding them to a shell script file that you load in ~/.zshrc via `source /path/to/my/shell-customization-script`.

### Don't Repeat Yourself

These git aliases allow omitting "git " with virtually all git usage:

```bash
alias status="git status"
alias gdiff="git diff" # diff would collide with /usr/bin/diff
alias restore="git restore"
alias add="git add"
alias commit="git commit"
alias push="git push"
alias branch="git branch"
alias checkout="git checkout"
alias pull="git pull"
alias revert="git revert"
alias greset="git reset" # reset would collide with /usr/bin/reset
alias remote="git remote"
```

### When You're [Gitty](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gitty")

This command allows to accelerate the most basic git use. It adds, commits and pushes all changes:

```bash
gitty() {
    if [ "$1" = "" ] # don't do shit without a message
    then
        echo "ðŸ›‘ gimmme some message!!!"
    else
        add .
        commit -m $1
        push

        remoteBranch=$(branch -r)
        echo "âœ… pushed to:$remoteBranch"
    fi

    echo "ðŸ¤ª https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gitty"
}
```

You use it like so:

```bash
gitty "Fix UI bug"
```
